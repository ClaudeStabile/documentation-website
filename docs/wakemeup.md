# Wake Words

We provide an online tool that enables your contribution on recording anonymous voice audio samples. Those samples are used to train data models of Wake Words recognition (i.e "LinTO")

We'll also get thrilled if you help us confirm the validity of audio samples created by other users. Listen to these samples and give us your opinion as to whether the keywords pronounced are audible and in accordance with the instructions.

### French
