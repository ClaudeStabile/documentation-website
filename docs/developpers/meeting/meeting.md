# LinTO for meetings & Smart Scribe

Digital workspaces are a source for important data lakes in which intelligent tools, boosted by machine learning, play an increasingly important role in extracting content, meaning and value.

Video conferencing solutions and digital recorders are thus equipped with automatic transcription systems, instantaneous discussion channels are scrutinized by text analysis extracting and understanding natural language...

On this AI topic, the digital giants offer APIs, often used by virtual "scribes" applications that offer end-users the ability to abstract, annotate, classify or even search for content created during exchanges within a company. These applications, which becomes more and more popular, are often based on proprietary technologies and **do not offer the expected conditions for processing sensitive data (finance, banking, medical, etc.) while displaying an insufficient level of performance for languages other than English**.
