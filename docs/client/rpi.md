# LinTO Maker 
This section deal with LinTO maker's version on Raspberry Pi.

***Why Raspberry ?***

We choose to develop a early version on raspberry for many reason:
* It is cheap and easely available.
* It packs enough punch for the desired on device operations.
* There is a bunch of hardware directly plugable such as screens and microphones.
* The community and its projects are amazing.

In outline, it is a perfect tool for prototyping and testing LinTO in real conditions.
